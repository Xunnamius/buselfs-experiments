% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document. Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Summarize introduction/contributions, methodology, conclusion in 250? interesting words or less.

\section{Introduction}
Is this worth it? Why? Argue project meaningfulness. Status quo disk encryption has a non-trivial cost. Show empirically.
This cost can be lessened, a trade-off made. What tradeoff(s)? Tease apart and enumerate different contributions.

Characterize cost. ``We save X at the cost of Y''. DE is the proiblem. The solution is Z. It costs Y. If willing to pay.

Caveats, limitations, and how they're handled.
