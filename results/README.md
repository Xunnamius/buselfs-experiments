# Experimental Results

They can be found organized by directory. Look for the numerical directories,
each signifying a year (i.e. `2015-2017/`, `2018/`, `2019/`). The library that
the simple testrunner scripts (below) are based on is *libcruncher*
(`libcruncher/`) and was created specifically to crunch StrongBox data results.

## Results Plotters

`plotresults-asplos17.py` is compatible with the results files generated by:

* `testrunner-asplos17.py`
* `testrunner-freerun.py`

`plotresults-tspace.py` is compatible with the results files generated by:

* `testrunner-optimal-flknug.py`
* `testrunner-swap2019.py`

## Tools

Use `clearresults.sh` to permanently and irrecoverably delete all the `*.result`
files in this directory.

Use `storeresults.sh` to capture all the free floating `*.result` files in this
directory and organize them. They will become visible to version control at this
point as well.
